query: "Summarize the mandatory minimum rest hour
        requirements for watch-keeping personnel under
        the STCW Convention, including how these periods
        can be divided and any permissible exceptions."

answer: The STCW Convention mandates the following for watch-keeping personnel:
        Daily Minimum: A minimum of 10 hours of rest in any 24-hour period.
        Weekly Minimum: A total of at least 77 hours of rest in any 7-day period.
        Division of Rest: The daily 10 hours may be divided into no more than two periods.
        One of these periods must be at least 6 hours long, and the other must be no
        less than one hour.
        Exceptions: Administrations may allow a reduction to 70 hours of rest in a
        7-day period, but this exception cannot last for more than two weeks.
        The interval between two periods of exception must be at least twice the
        duration of the exception itself.
